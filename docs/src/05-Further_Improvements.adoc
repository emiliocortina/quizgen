== Future improvements

The _templates_ model that the program uses has some limitations.

It requires the user to know the
(possibly huge amount of) available _templates_.

It is also not easy to maintain for the developers, new properties and domains may appear, which would
require to define new templates to cover these new properties

However, moving away from the current approach would require to tackle certain points.

=== Selection of properties

Some entities do not have a value defined for certain properties.

The program should infer the type of the entity and automatically
choose the properties used to generate questions based on the context.


=== Natural language generation

The program should be able to transform a semantic property into a well-formed question in natural language.
